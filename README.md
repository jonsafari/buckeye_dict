The **Buckeye Pronunciation Dictionary** is a data-driven English pronunciation dictionary, suitable for use in speech recognition systems and other applications that use phonological information about English words.
It is comparable to [CMUDict][], but is derived from a large-scale speech corpus, rather than annotator intuitions.

## File Format
The dictionary consists a four columns separated by tabs:

1. Word
2. Phonological transcription, derived from [Arpabet][]
3. Number of occurrences in corpus
4. Mean length of utterance
